# Help more international developers

Building a good open-source software is important, however the ultimate goal is helping more developers around the world. Most of our team members and users are not English background and it's important to translate to their native language in order to help them better. As today, here are the translators and we would love to have more help form the community to translate to other languages.


We would love to thanks to the following contributors. However we need more help on other languages as well: 

🇦🇺 English - Bill
🇨🇳 简体中文 - Bill
🇯🇵 日本語 - @kotarella1110
🇰🇷 한국어 - @adhrinae
🇫🇷 Français
🇮🇹 Italiano
🇧🇷 Português - @kevenleone
🇪🇸 Español
