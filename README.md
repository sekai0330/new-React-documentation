## Help more international developers
    
Building good open-source software is important, however, the ultimate goal is always helping more developers around the world. Most of our users are non-English background and it's important to translate to their native language to help them understand better. 
    
We would love to thanks the following contributors. However, we need more help with other languages as well: 
    
- 🇦🇺 English - Bill
- 🇨🇳 简体中文 - Bill
- 🇯🇵 日本語 - @kotarella1110
- 🇰🇷 한국어 - @adhrinae
- 🇫🇷 Français - ??
- 🇮🇹 Italiano - ??
- 🇧🇷 Português - @kevenleone
- 🇪🇸 Español - ??
- 🇷🇺 Русский - ??

#### How can you help?

We have setup the website so it's easy to translate (i18n). The entire site of translation is captured under `/data` folder.

- Add your language into `languages.js`
- Create a new folder for your language
- Create file for each pages
